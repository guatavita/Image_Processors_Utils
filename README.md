### Dependencies
brianmanderson/Image_Processors_Module
https://github.com/brianmanderson/Image_Processors_Module.git

### How to use
This module was mostly designed to run pre_process() and post_process() in deep learning pipelines.
These pipelines are for tf.data.TFRecordDataset() to run a model training in Tensorflow (>2) or for data input to be infered by any model.
See examples of inference pipeline using these image pre-/post-processors: https://github.com/brianmanderson/Prediction_Model_Class
